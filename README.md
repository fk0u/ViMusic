## Apple Music-Style Lyrics Experience

This fork introduces a premium Apple Music-inspired lyrics experience with the following enhancements:

* **Immersive Full-Screen Mode**: Dedicated full-screen experience with animated gradient backdrop
* **Sharp Word Highlighting**: Left-to-right solid fill highlighting instead of gradient wipe for clearer visual tracking
* **Text Emphasis**: Active lines are emphasized with scaling and font weight changes
* **Subtle Glow Effects**: Active words receive subtle shadow effects for better visibility
* **Vertical Positioning**: Dynamic vertical alignment to position active lyrics at the optimal reading position
* **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced easing curves for smoother transitions between lines

To use this feature:

The feature works best with word-synced lyrics from LyricsPlus provider, but also supports line-synced lyrics.
